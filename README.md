# Hello, I'm Isak

I'm a backend-first developer who loves systems, logic, and building things.  
I’m especially drawn to open source, low-level infrastructure, real-time systems, and clean logic.

Currently learning, tinkering, and improving — one commit at a time.  
Spending the next year at **Komvux** to prepare for university.
